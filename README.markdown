django-iweathercal
==================

This outputs a proper ics/ical formatted file that inserts weather forecast information into your calendars. You are able to subscribe to the URL and have it updated automatically.

Some work still needs to be done, but it works for now.

Would like to move to WeatherUnderground so that 5 day forecasts would be possible...for now Yahoo Weather only supplies a 2 day forecast.


to use
